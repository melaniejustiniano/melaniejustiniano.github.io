			Welcome! This visualization was done by Matt Sheets and Melanie Justiniano to explore the evolution of music genres in the United States. This is only a small sample of the amount of genres that we could have shown, but these genres were the most interesting to us as we felt they really told a story.

			</p>

			<p>

			Every time an artist in a selected genre begins their career, a circle pops up representing the city they originated in. The bigger the circle is, the more artists have originated in a city. The darker the city is, the more recently it has had an artist originate there. 

			</p>

			<p>

			The slider is a line graph representation of the number of artists originating in that year over time. The number on top of the slider is the number of artists originated in the current year, and the number below it is the current year.

			</p>

			<p>

			The bar graph on the side panel is an overview of the top five most popular cities in the genre. It is scaled with all genres, so a genre with many short bars is a smaller genre than one with many tall bars. The side panel also tells you how many artists in our sample were in the current genre.

			</p>

			<p>

			You can hover over an city to see the name of the city. You can click on a city to see which artists have originated there. The artists in bold have originated by the current year the visualization is on. The other artists in the list represent artists that have no originated yet, but will in the future. The side visualization tells you both how many artists will originate in that city and how many artists have originated by the current year. The year next to the artist represents the year they started.

			</p>

			<p>

			You can click on a state to zoom in on it, and the circles will all become smaller and one size. This is so that you can see the cities more individually in places where they are cluttered. To view the entire map, simply click on the state you're zoomed in on again.
			
			</p>

			<p>

			You can navigate time with the slider below the map, with the buttons on the side panel, or with the left and right arrow keys. The play button and the spacebar start the visualization at the genre's origin date and move through the years until the last artist originates in the genre. The other interactive buttons bring you to the first and last years, respectively.

			</p>

			<p>
			
			You can change genres either through the drop-down menu or by using the up and down arrow keys followed by the enter key.
