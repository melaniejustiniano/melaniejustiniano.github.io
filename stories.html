			<h2>Stories?</h2>
			<p>
				This page serves to document some interesting phenomena that we have discovered while experimenting with our visualization. It is not intended ot provide a historical summary of the development of specific genres, but only hopes to bring to light interesting scenarios that you might experiment with yourself. Happy surfing!
			</p>
			
			<h2>East Coast vs. West Coast</h2>
			<p>
				Starting in New York with Grandmaster Flash in 1970, the evolution of popular artists in the rap genre can be seen as a race between the East Coast and West Coast scenes. New York and its surrounding cities play the principal role on the East Coast featuring artists such as the Beastie Boys and De La Soul. The West Coast was dominated by artists coming from L.A. and it's surrounding suburbs, most notably Compton. Artists such as NWA, the group in which Dr. Dre got his start, and Coolio helped to pioneer the West Coast scene.
			</p>
			<p>
				Genreaology actually reveals an interesting fact about the East Coast vs. West Coast competition in rap and that is that 2Pac, the figure head of the West Coast scene, was actually originally from New York!
			</p>

			<h2>The Seattle Sound</h2>
			<p>
				Sometimes called the Seattle sound, Grunge is seen in the visualization to develop and evolve primarily in Seattle and surrounding cities. That being said, in this visualization, one can see that N.Y. and especially L.A. play a prominent role in the development of the Seattle sound. While definitely the originator of the sound, Seattle is seen in the Genre Overiview bar graph to play a less dominant role than some might think.
			</p>

			<h2>Nashville: The Hottest of Spots</h2>
			<p>
				While the Country music genre is commonly associated with the South, and when people think Nashville, they think both music and country in particular, many might not realize just how prominent a role Nashville has played in churning out popular Country music artists. Nashville has produced the most popular artists for any given genre, this being Country, out of all the cities in our dataset. By a long shot.
			</p>

			<h2>A Tale of Dos Ciudades</h2>
			<p>
				The Latin music genre, according to our dataset, is one of the most region-centric genres, coming almost entirely from Miami and New York.
