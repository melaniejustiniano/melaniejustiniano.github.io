Design Studio - Group Feedback
==============================

Feedback
--------

- The addition of a play button would allow users of the visualization to watch the progress/evolution of genres over the course of time more intuitively than dragging a slider.
- It might be interesting to see a more aggregated view of the development of the genres. One way of doing this would be to use a cloropleth map. Allowing for greater aggregation might reveal a more linear flow and development of a genre over the course of time.
- Adding a y-axis to the slider will provide some perspective to viewers as to how may artists are in a genre at a given time. While the y-axis still makes sense to have a normalized height, it would be useful for comparing genres to have some numbers to go by.
- The feature in which you can hover over circles/states to see an list of artists from that location, would add a great degree of depth to the visualization.

Adapting Input
--------------

Some of the issues presented to us were one's we had previously debated ourselves, but having a new, third party perspective, has really helped to shed light on some of our better and worse design decisions. We definitely intend to add the play button, and the y-axis is a simple yet effective addition. The list of artists also allows for greater exploration and we intend to code this for the next submission.

Switching to cloropleth is an interesting decision that could provide a greater understanding, especially in the aggregate, of the data. It would be interesting to allow viewers to switch between cloropleth and point (current technique) maps. There is some concern as to whether or not this would clutter the visualization and confuse users, but in the end, it could lead to multiple uses and views of the same data. We will likely continue as planned, and based on where we end up, possibly add this feature.

Feedback from:
- Lucas Freitas
- Charlie Lovett

The feedback was extremely useful. As previously mentioned, having the input of a third party made a huge difference, and it helped to clarify some of the decisions we had been struggling with as well as provide us guidance as to how to make our visualizaiton more educative! The feedback was definitely fair and insightful.
